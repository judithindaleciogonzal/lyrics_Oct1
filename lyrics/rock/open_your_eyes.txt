Open Your Eyes
Alter Bridge

Looking back I clearly see
What it is that's killing me
Through the eyes I want to know
See a vision once let go
I had it all
Well constantly it burdens me
How to trust, I can't believe
I lost the faith, I lost the love
But when the day is done
Will they open their eyes, and realize we are one
On and on we stand alone until our day is gone
Will they open their eyes, and realize we are one
I love the way I feel today 
And how I know the sun will fade
Darker days seem to be
What will always live in me
But still I run
Its hard to walk this path alone
Hard to know which way to go
Will I ever save this day?
Will they ever change?
Will they open their eyes, and realize we are one
On and on we stand alone until our day is gone
Will they open their eyes, and realize we are one
Still today we carry on, I know our day will come
Will they open their eyes, and realize we are one
Will they open their eyes, and realize we are one
Hard to walk this path alone
Hard to know which way to go
Will they open their eyes, and realize we are one
Lost the faith, Lost the love
But when the day is done
Will they open their eyes, and realize we are one
