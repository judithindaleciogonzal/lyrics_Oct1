There's all kinds of music
Everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast
Some like it slow
Some like it hot
Some like it blue
Some like it old
And some like it new

Now I'm not knockin' country
And I'm not rappin' rap
Big band swing just ain't my thing
Alternative ain't my snap

The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

Music makes you happy
Or it can make you sad
It can turn the worst day
To the best you ever had
For entertainment value
If I had to choose
You and me might disagree
'Cause I like rhythm and blues

Now I'm not dissin' disco
Not sayin' punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal
'Cause I gotta have that funk

The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

There's people who tell you
To get with the times
It doesn't even matter
If your poem rhymes
But I'm here to tell you
Whatever comes along
There's something here for everyone
There ain't no right or wrong

If soft rock makes you lazy
Classical leaves you flat
And fusion drives you crazy
Then snap funk is where it's at

The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

I like soul! With a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'

Oh, I like soul
(With a capital 'S')
Oh, don't ya know I like soul
(With a capital 'S')
You gotta gimme some of that soul, ha
(With a capital 'S')
Yes, I like soul
(With a capital 'S')

With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'

Hey yea...

Yo fellas
Sounds like some of that Oakland soul music
You know what I'm talking about?

(They done found the stroke
Done found the Oakland stroke
They done found the stroke
Done found the Oakland stroke)

(Soul, with a capital 'S')
Gimme some of that soul
(With a capital 'S')
Got to have that soul
(With a capital 'S')
(With a capital 'S')
That's what I like
(With a capital 'S')
Sweet soul music
(With a capital 'S')
